# 🗓️ **Super Calendar** – The Last Calendar You'll Ever Need (Or Want) 𓃵

Tired of calendars that just show you the date? **Same.** That’s why **Super Calendar** exists – a powerful, feature-rich calendar application to make scheduling your chaos **fun**, **functional**, and maybe even **life-changing**. -
Designed to start simple and scale endlessly, this project aims to become the most optimized and advanced calendar **ever made**.

Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project is on a mission to be either the **best calendar ever made** or the **most hilariously over-engineered disaster in history**.

## 🔥 Features That Actually Work (So Far):

- ⬅️➡️ **Month Navigation** – Travel through time (at least in calendar form).
- 🌟 **Date Highlighting** – Never forget what day it is (as long as it’s today).
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Looks great on phones, laptops, and even 1998 monitors.
- ✨ **Hover Effects** – Because your mouse deserves to Do something.

## 🔧 Coming Soon (If We Don’t Burn Out First):

- 🌦️ **Weather Forecasts** – Plan your BBQs or Netflix binges without surprises.
- 🔔 **Reminders & Notifications** – Because sticky notes fall off.
- 👤 **User Accounts** – Save your schedule, preferences, and bad decisions forever.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Something** – "Someone else" doing something cuz we can't trust you with sh*t.
- 😳 **Future sight** - know the future...
- 👕 **Outfit Recommendations** – Finally, someone telling you what to wear based on the weather.
- 📅 **Multi-View Modes** – Day, week, month, and maybe even existential crisis view.
- 🎨 **Custom Themes** – Match your calendar to your mood (dark mode for Monday vibes😌).
- ☁️ **Cloud Syncing** – So you can’t escape your schedule, even if you try.
- 🐷 **Mother Contact collection** - Retreaves user's mom's Contact details for machine learning and Big Data😄📈.
  

## 🎯 **Goals (Sort of):**

Make this the **ultimate scheduling tool**—or at least something that doesn’t crash immediately. Either way, it’s bound to be **ridiculous**, **over-engineered**, and just Cool.
