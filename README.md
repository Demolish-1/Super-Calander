🗓️ Super Calendar – The Last Calendar You'll Ever Need (Or Want) 💥
Are you tired of boring calendars that just tell you the date? Same. That’s why Super Calendar exists—to make scheduling your chaos fun, functional, and maybe even life-changing. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is on a mission to be either the best calendar ever made or the most hilariously over-engineered disaster in history.

🔥 Features That Actually Work (So Far):
⬅️➡️ Month Navigation – Go back in time or into the future (only in calendar form, sorry).
🌟 Date Highlighting – Never forget what day it is (as long as it’s today).
📱 Responsive Design – Looks good on your phone, laptop, or 1998 monitor.
✨ Hover Effects – Because your mouse deserves some sparkle.
🔧 Coming Soon (If We Don’t Burn Out First):
🌦️ Weather Forecasts – Plan your BBQs or Netflix binges without surprises.
🔔 Reminders & Notifications – Because sticky notes fall off.
👤 User Accounts – Save your schedule, preferences, and bad decisions forever.
🤖 AI-Powered Suggestions –
🧠 Smart event planning so you can pretend to be organized.
👕 Outfit recommendations based on weather (finally, someone telling you what to wear).
📅 Multi-View Modes – Day, week, month, and maybe even existential crisis view.
🎨 Custom Themes – Match your calendar to your mood (dark mode for Monday vibes).
☁️ Cloud Syncing – So you can’t escape your schedule even if you try.
🎯 Goals (Sort of):
Make this the ultimate scheduling tool—or at least something that doesn’t crash immediately. Either way, it’s bound to be ridiculous, over-engineered, and just barely optimized.
